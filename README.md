# Breast_Cancer_Detection_ML
This project is based on Machine Learning Algorighms.
The ML algorithms are used to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. These algorithms take the dataset of various 
previous diagnosis of patients. Machine learning model is trained using Machine Learning algorithms and the dataset.

The dataset is taken from UCI repository. It is the result of a survey conducted in US by Winconsin Diagnosis for Breast Cancer (WDBC).
